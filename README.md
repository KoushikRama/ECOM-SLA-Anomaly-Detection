## 📖 About This Project

In high-scale e-commerce environments, static thresholds for Service Level Agreements (SLAs) fail to account for seasonal traffic patterns and shifting system baselines. This project implements a **Predictive Anomaly Detection System** that moves beyond static rules.

By leveraging **XGBoost Regressors** to model "normal" system behavior, the pipeline calculates real-time residuals to distinguish between expected fluctuations (like peak hour spikes) and genuine system failures. The result is a robust, production-ready deployment utilizing a **Serverless SageMaker** architecture, designed to minimize operational overhead while maximizing detection accuracy.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![System Architecture](https://github.com/KoushikRama/CRUD-SLA-Anomaly-Detection/blob/main/images/Architecture.png) 

### Deployment Flow:
1. **Streamlit UI:** Sends SLA metric data via HTTPS.
2. **API Gateway:** Securely routes requests to the model endpoint.
3. **SageMaker Serverless Endpoint:** Runs the XGBoost inference container.
4. **S3 Bucket:** Stores model artifacts, feature scalers, and calculated thresholds.

---

## 🧠 System Overview

This project is a **complete end-to-end ML pipeline**, covering:

- Synthetic data generation (Hourly patterns & noise)
- Feature engineering (Time-series cyclical encoding)
- Model training (XGBoost Regressors per metric)
- Threshold computation (Residual-based)
- SageMaker Serverless deployment
- API Gateway integration
- Streamlit dashboard for real-time visualization

## 🤖 Model (XGBoost Residual-Based)

---

### 🔍 Approach

- Train regression models for each SLA metric
- Predict expected values
- Compute residuals (actual vs predicted)
- Apply threshold-based anomaly detection

---

### ⚙️ Pipeline

```
Features → XGBoost → Prediction → Residual → Threshold → Alert
```
---

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

This section covers the environment setup and installation required to run the pipeline locally and connect it to AWS services.

---

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and configured:

- **Python 3.9+**
- **AWS CLI** (configured via `aws configure`)
- **Streamlit** (for UI)

#### Required AWS Permissions

Your IAM user/role must have access to:

- `AmazonS3FullAccess`
- `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess`
- `AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator`

---

### 2. Installation Steps

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/KoushikRama/CRUD-SLA-Anomaly-Detection.git
cd CRUD-SLA-Anomaly-Detection

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Model Training

Run the full pipeline:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

This step performs:

- Data generation
- Feature engineering
- Model training (XGBoost)
- Threshold computation
- Model artifact preparation

---

### 4. Infrastructure Setup

**Step 1: Create S3 Bucket**

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://your-unique-s3-bucket-name
```
This bucket is used to store:

- Training data
- Model artifacts

**Step 2: Model Packaging**

The model must be packaged into a .tar.gz file for SageMaker.

This includes:

This includes:
- Trained model
- `inference.py`
- `feature_engineering.py`

```
cd sagemaker_tar/
tar -czvf model.tar.gz *
```

**Step 3: Upload to S3 Bucket**

```bash
aws s3 cp model.tar.gz s3://your-unique-s3-bucket-name/
```

---

```

---

### 7. API Gateway Setup

To expose the SageMaker endpoint as a REST API:

1. Open AWS API Gateway Console
2. Create a REST API
3. Add a POST method
4. Set:
    - Integration Type → AWS Service
    - Service → SageMaker
    - Action → InvokeEndpoint
5. Provide your Endpoint Name

📌 After deployment, replace the API URL in the UI config with your API Gateway endpoint.
